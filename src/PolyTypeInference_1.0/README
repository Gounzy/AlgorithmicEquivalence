Type inference tool
===================
Derives a polymorphic well-typing for a given program.

Usage

?- use_module(types).

?- types(+Filename).

To run a number of tests, type

?- test.


A command line version is produced by compiling using the Ciao compiler

Then run the analyser as follows.

% types 'myfile.pl'
